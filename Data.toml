description="Gene expression and clinical data from the TCGA breast cancer (BRCA) study (2012). Gene expression data were downloaded from https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/brca_2012 (file BRCA.exp.348.med.txt). Clinical data were obtained from https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11412 (Supp Table 1). Genes with missing data were removed from the gene expression data. Samples with gene expression data were selected from the original clinical data, and samples (rows) were aligned between both files."

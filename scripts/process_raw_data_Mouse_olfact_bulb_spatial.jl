The ST datasets containing the gene counts for each spot are given in two formats, a JSON file that contains one record for each spot-gene count and a count-matrix where gene names are columns and spot coordinates are rows. For all the datasets the spots outside tissue were removed. The JSON files are kept for compatibility with older versions of the ST Viewer (link). The coordinates of the spots were adjusted to account for variations during printing of the arrays.

Use replicate 11 like in the SpatialDE paper.
